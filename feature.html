                <h2>My journey as a Scrimba Pro student</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">Now I'm coming to the end of Module 6 of 13, and am 42% of the way through the Frontend Developer course, this seems a good time to have a look at the rest of the material and draw up my own personal course completion plan.</p>

                <h4>My journey so far</h4>
                <p class="intro-detail-text">
                    After some time playing around with HTML and CSS as a hobby during the Covid lockdowns I decided to quit my job and focus on learning to code in pursuit of a more challenging and rewarding career. I sampled a variety of learning material and courses until enrolling as a Scrimba Pro earlier this year.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-detail-text">
                    Now I've reached the end of Module 6, with this learning journal being the solo project for the module, and I have learnt so much in those first 6 modules!
                </p>

                <h4>Where to next?</h4>
                <p class="intro-detail-text">
                    It would be fantastic to have unlimited time to study, but that is not the case for me, so I will make use of the blogs in this journal to take a look at the remaining seven modules and try and map out the rest of my journey towards my new career.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-detail-text">
                    I will also take a look at some of the other courses offered by Scrimba and other learning providers. As coding looks like an enormous and continually-evolving subject the learning journey might never end!
